This project uses ant to deploy and execute. Tomcat is required to run it on localhost server.

Note: to run this project with HSQLDB (easiest way):
1. Start the HSQLDB server by using "ant start-hsqldb" after cd'ing to the database directory. Let it hang.
   Create a new window to proceed and use command "ant load-hsqldb" to execute the sql statements.
   
2. Use "ant load-hsqldb" (still in database directory)
   
3. Use the various ant command as listed in build.xml to achieve the required results.

To use a real DB: you need to define environment variables as discussed in build.xml
  For Oracle database, set up env variables ORACLE_USER, ORACLE_PW, ORACLE_SITE
  For MySQL use, set up env vars MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PW, MYSQL_SITE
  //You can change the above variables in the project root dir build.xml, database buiild.xml and your subsequent system environment.
